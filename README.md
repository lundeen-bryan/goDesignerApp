## Description
This was part 2 of Geoff Blake’s courses, the first was called “Website Wireframing with HTML5 & CSS3” where we made the wireframe layout. This course picks up from there to learn applying CSS styles to the wireframe. 
It was generally very easy to learn, building as a responsive site was out of the scope of this small course, but it is touched on. 
A lot of interesting links were given to help design things in CSS. 
The styling came with images needed but also explained how to find those images. 
Gave this a 4.5 star rating and could have been improved by using vscode and updating some of the websites that were referenced. Such as the old Yahoo developer kit which no longer exists.
